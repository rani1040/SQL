SQL stands for structured Query language,which is used to interact with data store in Relatinal databse
we can think relational database as a collection of tables.
Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity.
For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. 
Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. 
For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.
EMPLOYEE TABLE
id	name	age	nationality
1	Jessica	22	Ireland
2	Gabriel	48	France
3	Laura	  36	USA


1. SELECTing single columns
we can select data from a table using select statement,in the below query, SELECT and FROM are called keywords. In SQL, keywords are not case-sensitive
   for example : SELECT column_name
                 FROM Table_Name;
                 
                 
2. SELECTing multiple columns
To select multiple columns from a table, simply separate the column names with commas!
   for example: SELECT column1_name, column2_name
                FROM Table_name;
Typing out every column name
  for example:
    SELECT *
    FROM people;
If you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned:
  for exanple:
    SELECT *
    FROM people
    LIMIT 10;

3. SELECT DISTINCT
If you want to select all the unique values from a column, you can use the DISTINCT keyword.
for example:
  SELECT DISTINCT language
  FROM films;
  
4.Learning to COUNT
 The COUNT() function lets you do this by returning the number of rows in one or more columns.
 For example, this code gives the number of rows in the people table:
for example:
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM people;
    
5.Filtering results
In SQL, the WHERE keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

= equal
<> not equal
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
For example, you can filter text records such as title. The following code returns all films with the title 'Metropolis':

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE title = 'Metropolis';
Notice that the WHERE clause always comes after the FROM statement!

Note that in this course we will use <> and not != for the not equal operator, as per the SQL standard.


SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE country = 'China';
Now it's your turn to practice using WHERE with text values!

Important: in PostgreSQL (the version of SQL we're using), you must use single quotes with WHERE.

6. WHERE AND
      SELECT title
      FROM films
      WHERE release_year > 1994
      AND release_year < 2000;


When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!

7.BETWEEN
Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the BETWEEN keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range.t's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;
Similar to the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN clause can be used with multiple AND and OR operators
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';


8. IN
IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, making it easier and quicker to specify multiple OR conditions! Neat, right?
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)




8.NULL
In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. You can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;
As you can see, IS NULL is useful when combined with WHERE to figure out what data you're missing.

Sometimes, you'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not NULL. To do this, you can use the IS NOT NULL operator.

For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.

SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;

9. NOT LIKE
the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with LIKE:

The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. For example, the following query matches companies like 'Data', 'DataC' 'DataCamp', 'DataMind', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'Data%';
The _ wildcard will match a single character. For example, the following query matches companies like 'DataCamp', 'DataComp', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'DataC_mp';
You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.
